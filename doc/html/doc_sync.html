	<p>
	  SooperLooper can quantize most operations with a choice of
	  several sources and parameters.  When enabled, the quantize
	  operations affect all loops.
	</p>

	<center><img src="sync_controls.png"></center>

	<p>
	  The <b>sync to</b> control
	  chooses what source to use for synchronization: None,
	  Internal Tempo, MIDI clock, JACK transport, or any of the
	  existing loops.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The <b>tempo</b> control shows the current tempo,
	  and is only editable directly when <b>sync to</b> is set to
	  None or Internal.   When MIDI clock is selected, the tempo
	  will be updated to reflect the estimated tempo based on any
	  incoming MIDI clock ticks.  When JACK transport is selected,
	  it will always reflect the tempo specified by the current
	  JACK time master (if any).  However, when one of the loops
	  is selected as the sync source, the tempo is defined
	  entirely by the current loop's length and the
	  <b>8th/cycle</b> parameter.

	</p>

	<p> The <b>tap</b> button lets you tap in a tempo when in
	  Internal (or None) sync-to mode.  This function can also be
	  done with a keybinding ('t' by default) and a MIDI binding.
	  The tap button also pulses with the current tempo giving a
	  visual indication of it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The <b>8th/cycle</b> parameter defines how many 8th notes as
	  defined by the current tempo (there are 2 eighths per beat)
	  are in a cycle of a current loop, or a potential loop.  As
	  described below, the cycle length is useful as a
	  quantization boundary, as well as an eighth-note itself.

	</p>
	<p>
	  The <b>quantize</b> parameter defines when
	operations sync to in reference to the sync source.  The
	available choices are Off, Cycle, 8th, and Loop.  Note that no
	sync will ever occur if this value is set to Off.
	When the sync source is another loop, the choices are all
	valid.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the <b>sync</b> option is checked for a
	  particular loop, operations will be quantized to the
	  selected boundary.  This includes Record,  Multiply,
	  Replace, Substitute, Insert, Reverse, Trigger, and Once.
	  Note that Overdub is never quantized.  When a command is
	  performed, the actual operation won't start/stop until the
	  precise moment of the next sync boundary arrives.  For
	  instance, when the sync source is a loop, and the quantize
	  parameter is Cycle, a Record operation will start and stop
	  on an exact cycle boundary of the source loop.  More
	  interesting polyrhythms are possible when using 8ths as the
	  quantize parameter, for example.

	</p>

	<p>
	  The <b>play sync</b> option for a loop causes the
	  playback of the loop to be coerced to remain in sync with
	  the selected syncto source.  Currently, this is done by
	  retriggering the loop if an external sync boundary occurs
	  when near a loop boundary (+/- the current quantize type).
	  This technique is particulary suitable for maintaining playback sync
	  with MIDI clock which may drift with respect to the audio
	  playback.  Note that it does <b>not</b> currently do any
	  timestretching or rate resampling, so it isn't suitable for
	  dealing with external tempo changes from the original recorded loop's
	  tempo.
