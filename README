DESCRIPTION

SooperLooper is a looping sampler very much like the Gibson/Oberheim
Echoplex Digital Pro.  The EDP feature-set is powerful, proven, and
popular, hence the decision to follow its lead. SooperLooper is a true
realtime software looper if used with a low-latency Linux kernel and
the proper audio buffer configuration.

I have never used an actual EDP, but all the features are described in
the user's manual, which was an invaluable resource.  Take a look at
http://www.loopers-delight.com/tools/echoplex/echoplex.html to get the
manual and other tips.  Most of the LoopIII info applies.

FEATURES of SooperLooper shared with the EDP:
  Record
  Overdub
  Multiply
  Insert
  Replace
  Reverse
  Mute
  One Shot
  Undo
  Tap tempo delay mode
  Feedback and Mix parameters
  QuantizeMode and RoundMode toggles

Additional features of SooperLooper:
  Redo
  Scratch Mode w/ arbitrary playback rate


USAGE

The main engine is the executable 'sooperlooper'.  Either the GUI
'slgui' or the console based test client 'slconsole' can be run which
will communicate with a running sooperlooper engine or optionally
start one (not yet implemented).

Run 'sooperlooper -h' for command line option help.  Note the midi
binding file option -m and take a look at the examples oxy8.slb and
midiwizard.slb for the format to write your own.
